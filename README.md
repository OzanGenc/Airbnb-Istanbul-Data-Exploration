# Airbnb-Istanbul-Data-Exploration

Here, we conduct exploratory data analysis using [Airbnb data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for Istanbul. The data is compiled by Airbnb on April,28,2020 and you can find the [version of data] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AZnWn18wYpKoAEeZ3FckIxaBN3l-FLS_?usp=sharing) used in this analysis. We try to answer these questions; 

1) Which districts gained popularity in time for tourists to stay?
2) Which districts are most expensive to stay for tourists?
3) What do visitors say about most popular districts?
